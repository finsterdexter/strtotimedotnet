In theory this will operate similar to how the PHP strtotime functions. Instead of outputting a timestamp, we'll output a DateTime object, though. 

The main task I'm working on right now is porting PHP 5.3's unit tests for strtotime to this project and implement from those.

I'll also be using this as guidance, as well: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php
